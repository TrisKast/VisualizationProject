# VisualizationProject

This project was about the visualisation of the taxonomy and SEED and KEGG pathyway regulations of metagenomic data,
as well as their behaviour over multiple timepoints. The project is realised using FLASK, a webframework using the 
WSGI interface for communication between a webserver and webapplications in python.
The input data has to be in JSON format.
